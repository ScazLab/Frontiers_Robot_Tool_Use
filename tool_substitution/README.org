#+TITLE:     Tool Substitution 
#+AUTHOR:    Jake Brawer & Meiying Qin

* Description 
  So far this package primarily does two things:
   - Creates a minimum bounding box around 3D pointcloud
   - Measures shape similarity between to pointclouds via hamming distance

* Examples
  
Run

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
 python examples.py <tool>
#+END_SRC

Where tool \in {hammer, saw, guitar}, to get visualizations of bounding box for these tools.
